Dealing with the background Image in Blender 3d is a tricky concept. There are different views in blender. 
As we are working in a 3d mode we can view the same object in very many views of whihc 4 are very importnant 
to work with in blender.
They are 1.User Ortho (shortcut - 5)
         2.Top Ortho  (shortcut 5 then 7)
         3.Front Ortho  (shortcut 5 then 1)
         4.Right Ortho  (Shortcut 5 then 3)
         
The background image can only be seen in the top - ortho (5 then 7)  view Mode. It cannot be seen in any other mode.
So,see take care that you will only be seeing the width and length of the cubicla blocks that you are constructing. 
The height detail should  be created later after all the length and breadth details are in place.
Create a cuboic by 'Add' Option in the Menu. Then if you have gone through the tutorial yoiu must know about the
extend or the change size tool in the tool pane at the bottom. using that to modify your block's base to match that 
on the map. That way the proportions are matched. Donot forget to move the block only along Axes while doing all this 
because you are currently working with your view restriced to two dimensions only. Any movement done using your 
mouse might move the object arbitrarily in space which will affect the proportions. So ensure that while
creating move it in lines parallel to axes only(this is also discussed in tutorials)
